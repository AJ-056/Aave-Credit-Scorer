Wallet Score Analysis:
This document provides an analysis of the credit scores generated by the Aave V2 Wallet Credit Scorer. The scores, ranging from 0 to 1000, reflect the assessed reliability and risk profile of each wallet based on its on-chain transaction history.

Score Distribution:
The credit scores are distributed across the entire 0-1000 range. A histogram of the scores reveals the concentration of wallets at different credit levels. The distribution is concentrated in the middle ranges (400-700), with fewer wallets at the extreme low and high ends, which is typical for a healthy user base with varying levels of engagement and risk.

Analysis of Wallet Behavior by Score:
Low-Scoring Wallets (Score 0-400) ðŸ“‰:
Wallets in this tier exhibit high-risk or unreliable behavior.

Behavioral Profile: The primary characteristic of the lowest-scoring wallets is having one or more liquidations. A single liquidation event is heavily penalized and is the fastest way to obtain a near-zero score. Other common traits include a low repay_to_borrow_ratio (meaning they have outstanding debt relative to their repayments) and a very short transaction history (wallet_age_days).

Interpretation: These wallets are classified as high-risk. They may belong to users who take on excessive leverage, are inexperienced with managing DeFi debt, or are potentially bots engaging in high-risk, short-term strategies. They are not considered reliable participants from a credit perspective.

Mid-Range Wallets (Score 401-700) ðŸ“Š:
This group represents the "average" Aave user and constitutes the majority of the user base.

Behavioral Profile: These wallets typically have zero liquidations and a consistent transaction history. Their repayment ratios are often close to 1.0, indicating they responsibly manage their debt over time. They are active participants but may not be large-scale liquidity providers, or they may have a shorter history with the protocol compared to top-tier users.

Interpretation: These are considered standard, reliable users. They engage with the core functions of borrowing and lending without exhibiting overly risky behavior.

High-Scoring Wallets (Score 701-1000) ðŸ“ˆ:
These wallets are the gold standard of responsible and valuable protocol usage.

Behavioral Profile: High-scoring wallets have a perfect record of zero liquidations and a long, active transaction history. Critically, they demonstrate a high repay_to_borrow_ratio (often > 1.0) and a significant positive net_liquidity_provided_usd. This means they not only repay their debts reliably but also contribute substantial capital to the Aave ecosystem, enabling others to borrow.

Interpretation: These are highly trustworthy and valuable users. They are reliable borrowers and significant liquidity providers, contributing directly to the health, stability, and capital efficiency of the Aave protocol. They represent the ideal user from a risk-assessment standpoint.
